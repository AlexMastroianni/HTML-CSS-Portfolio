# week-2-challenge

This weeks challenge was to code and design a personal portfolio resembling a sample portfolio. Using semantic HTML, and CSS. Following the marking guidelines the web app is should have a tiled projects view, about me, contacts, an image and workable page links.

To start this project off I created a wireframe in Figma so when I came to programming my CSS I didnt need to worry about designing the page.  

After the wireframe was done I started building out the structure and content of my HTML using Lorem ipsum to fill up the space and design the page. 

From there I decided on a colour pallete to give my portfolio some level of nice design using bright colours as my highlights and different blues and white of different elemetns to brake up the page. 

Using display:flex,flexbox and media queries I made a fully responsive web app viewing from a desktop to a mobile.
